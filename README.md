# 🥦 NomCents: Affordable Nutrition Made Simple

**NomCents** is a full-stack web app that helps users make informed grocery choices by balancing both *nutrition* and *budget*. With rising food costs and limited time to plan meals, many people struggle to maintain a healthy diet without overspending — NomCents provides a simple, centralized way to track both.

---

## 🧠 Motivation

Nutrition apps focus on calories and macros. Budgeting apps focus on spending. But there isn't a tool that effectively combines both.  
NomCents bridges that gap — helping users make smarter food decisions by integrating cost-awareness with dietary tracking.

This project was developed as part of a university software engineering course.

## ⚙️ Getting Started (Local Development)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CMSC447-Software-Engineering-I-SP2025/Team-4-Repository.git
cd Team-4-Repository/frontend
```

### 2. Install frontend dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Install backend dependencies

```bash
cd ../backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add:

```
KROGER_API_KEY=your-kroger-api-key
KROGER_API_SECRET=your-kroger-api-secret
```

> 🔁 Kroger API keys expire every ~30 days and must be refreshed at [developer.kroger.com](https://developer.kroger.com/).  
> The USDA API key is already embedded in `backend/backend.py` and doesn’t require setup.

### 5. Run the app

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```

This runs both the frontend and backend concurrently.
